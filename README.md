## Formal Power Series

Formal power series represented by infinite streams, and implementation of their algebraic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **composition** and **inversion**. Definitions of several elementary analytic functions are provided.

## 10-adic Integers

10-adic Integers represented by infinite streams, and implementation of their arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, **exponentiation**, **square root** and **rooting**. Definitions of general idempotents in 10-adic ring are provided.
